# CAPSTONE DESIGN PROJECT/ AI INTERNSHIP UNDER THE KOREAN ACADEMY AFFILIATION WITH RAKSA SOLUTION

## AI TO DETECT CRIMINAL VEHICLE 

### Goals and Objectives
The main objective of this project is to design an intelligent system for security in public and secure areas through proper analysis of the vehicles.
 - Enhance Vehicle Security
 - Improve Monitoring Capabilities
 - Control Access
 - Ensure Data Accessibility
### Scope
This project will address the security requirement of public and sensitive sectors including tollgates, and malls, tarring lots, and other related places that require monitoring of vehicles.
- Real-Time Vehicle Identification
- Immediate Response
- Data Storage and Accessibility
### Tools and Technologies
- Roboflow
- Google Colab
- YOLOv8
### Background Information
The project is based on the development of recent improvements of OCR and CV technologies, which have been used in some fields including toll booth activation, traffic control, and security systems. 
Thus, incorporating these technologies with the YOLOv8 model, we designed the system that meets the requirements of vehicle security monitoring to offer a novel approach to reducing vehicle crimes.
